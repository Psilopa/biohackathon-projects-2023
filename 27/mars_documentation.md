# MARS: Multi-Repository Data Submission

## Introduction
MARS is a data brokering system for submitting multi-omics life sciences studies to multiple specialized repositories.
MARS is a versatile and modular Multi-Repository ISA Submission Framework that enables data producers and multiple data repositories to exchange information seamlessly using the same standardized ISA-JSON format. Unlike a centralized platform, MARS operates as a common framework, allowing for decentralized data submissions while ensuring consistent interpretation and validation of ISA-JSON containing metadata across various repositories.
MARS serves as a common ground where data producers and diverse data repositories can interact cohesively, sharing scientific metadata encoded in ISA-JSON format. The framework ensures mutual understanding and accurate interpretation of the data, preserving the important links between multi-omics data generated from the same biological source.

## Components in MARS
MARS is comprised of distinct components, each representing key roles in the data submission process. Together, they form the essential building blocks of MARS, enabling cohesive and reliable data submission to multiple repositories.
Each role performs specific functions and carries distinct responsibilities essential for the smooth operation of the system.

### ISA-JSON producers
This role includes research infrastructure or service facilities that operate platforms such as ARC, FAIRDOM-SEEK, ISA Creators or any other tool that generates ISA-JSON files.
* Function: Prepare research data in ISA-JSON format, generate and export ISA-JSON files.
* Responsibilities:
  * Ensure compatibility of the exported ISA-JSON files with the format expected by MARS.
  * Support and validate for the use of repositoriesâ€™ checklists, controlled vocabulary, ontology terms, and other required metadata.
 
### Data broker
This role includes research infrastructure or service facilities that operate a platform designed to streamline the data submission process to repositories. This platform serves as intermediary in MARS, facilitating seamless and efficient submission of data to various repositories. Data brokers play a vital role in ensuring the smooth flow of information within the system, connecting data producers with repositories effectively and securely
* Functions:
  * access to the metadata and data files, orchestrates the pairing of data and metadata,  
The data broker can have an ENA brokering account or not. The data brokering tool or service can be used with a personal account for data repositories.
Data broker reads receipts generated by the repositories and add the information into the ISA-JSON.
